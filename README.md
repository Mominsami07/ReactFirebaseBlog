# ReactFirebaseBlog
### Description
A single page blog application based on React, Redux, Materialize(front-end) & Firebase(backend).

### Functionality
It has embedded 3 systems: **Users system**, **Post system** and **Notification system**. All of these are build in a single react component-based application, all working **without refreshing the page even on updates**. 

To keep track of each change and the state of each component, it was used **Redux** and lots of other dependencies. The styling was done using a simple css framework based on Google design, called **Materialize**.

All the backend was done using **Firebase** which is a real-time database made by Google and incorporates a lot of other functions than just storing data. Basically, auth system, notifications and posting are all stored inside it, using its **functions** capabilities.
